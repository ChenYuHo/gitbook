# Guides

Here is an outline of common use cases in Weights & Biases, and our recommended approaches for organizing your machine learning projects.

1. [Grouping](grouping.md): Cross validation and experiments made up of training and evaluation stages need an extra layer of organization within a project
2. [Security](security.md): Understand the careful security standards we maintain to keep experiment data safe on our servers or in your [on-prem instance](../self-hosted/)
3. [Resuming](resuming.md): In the context of a preemptible instance, it's useful to be able to stop and restart model training
4. [Limits](limits.md): A guide to reasonable best practices for the volume of data to log
5. [Technical FAQ](technical-faq.md): Common questions from users setting up our tools
